# Plus Resources: Weather Project Template
[![Tests](https://github.com/BehnazShojaei/Python-project-weather-data/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BehnazShojaei/Python-project-weather-data/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A python script that processes csv files containing data about the weather, and converts them into meaningful text-based summaries. This is a test driven development project, with the code written to pass unit tests.

## TODO

- [x] Implement the methods in `weather.py`.
- [x] Verify that everything works as intended by running the tests with `python run_tests.py`.
- [x] Test/debug file for manually testing functions.
